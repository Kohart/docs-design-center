Manage and interact with GitHub-synchronized projects in API Designer and Design Center. 

* In API Designer, the xref:design-ghs-manage-projects.adoc#the-branch-selector-component[branch selector component] enables you to access your GitHub repository page, initiate a pull request, create and switch branches, and view diffs between branches. The component is located above the code panel in the API Designer text editor. 

* In the Design Center *Projects* list, a project’s *Details* pane enables you to view both GitHub sync status and repository URL - useful for troubleshooting connectivity issues. The *Details* pane also enables you to disable GitHub synchronization (you can also disable GitHub synchronization via the *Publish* options menu).

== The Branch Selector Component

=== Access the Component and Select a Branch

Access the branch selector component by clicking the project title (with current GitHub branch name) located at the top of the code panel:

The following dialog appears:

image:apid-ghs-branch-dialog.png[32%,32%]

The current GitHub branch appears first (with its commit hash), followed by a list of previously created feature branches. Clicking a branch name switches to the branch. 

NOTE: The *View in GitHub* button, *View Diff* button, and commit hash do not appear for non-GitHub-synchronized projects.

=== View Differences Between Branches

View differences between a branch and the current branch by clicking *View Diff*.

=== Delete a Branch

Delete a feature branch by clicking the *Delete branch* button ("X").

=== Open a Pull Request

Open a pull request by switching to a branch (other than the main branch) and then opening the branch component selector. The *Open Pull Request* button displays:

image:apid-ghs-open-pull-request-dialog.png[35%,35%]

Click *Open Pull Request*. You are redirected to the GitHub interface to complete the pull request.

=== Create a New Branch

Create a new feature branch from the current branch by specifying the new branch name in the *Create Branch* text field, then clicking the *Create* button ("+"). API Designer switches to the new branch and redirects you to the text editor. The new branch name displays above the code panel.

== The Projects Page

=== Determine if a Project is Synchronized with GitHub
The Design Center *Projects* page lists your specifications, fragments, and applications. Projects that are synchronized with GitHub contain the GitHub icon in the *Name* column, as demonstrated in the following example:

== The Project Details Panel

=== View the GitHub Repository URL

View the GitHub repository URL in a selected project’s *Detail* pane (or via the *Publish* options menu). Click the *Copy* button to copy the URL contents into the clipboard.

The *Details* pane includes the following selectable text field:

image:apid-ghs-view-url.png[30%,30%]

=== View GitHub Synchronization Status

View GitHub synchronization status in a selected project’s *Details* pane.

The *Details* pane includes the following indicator:

image:apid-ghs-sync-status-indicator.png[20%,20%]

The indicator displays *Not Available* if you have not authorized the GitHub Synchronization application in your GitHub account, or if you are not a member of a GitHub synchronized-authorized GitHub organization. In these cases, you can view the project in API Designer as read-only.  

See xref:design-ghs-install-authorize.adoc[Install and Authorize the MuleSoft GitHub Sync Application].

=== Disable GitHub Synchronization

Disable GitHub synchronization status in a selected project’s *Details* panel. 

Click the *Disable Sync* button:

image:apid-ghs-disable-sync-button.png[12%,12%]

The *Disable GitHub Sync* dialog appears. You are asked to confirm disabling sync between your project and GitHub. Enter the project name in the confirmation text field, then click *Disable Sync*. This action cannot be undone.
