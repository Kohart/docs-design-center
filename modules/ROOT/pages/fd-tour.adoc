Flow Designer's visual orientation gives you the tools to build Mule applications visually, so that you can see from end to end how data moves through each flow.

== The features of the Flow Designer interface

The Flow Designer's features are organized into five areas.

.The five areas of the Flow Designer interface
image::FD-annotated.png[]

. The canvas
+
Here you create flows in a project.
+
In the top-left corner of the canvas are the names of the project and the flow.
. The panes
+
Click the top icon to open the *Project* pane, which lists a project's flows, the configurations that are being used, and any global data types that have been defined.
+
Click the bottom icon to open the *Dependencies* pane, which lists a project's dependencies.
+
You can hide the panes by clicking the icon of whichever pane is open. To show the panes again, click either icon.
+
What are reusable configurations?:: When you add a card that connects to another system, you specify how Flow Designer can locate and authenticate to that system. For example, if you add a Database card to a flow, you need to specify the type of database, its host, other connectivity information, and how to authenticate. The set of this information is called a _configuration_. After you add one Database card, the next Database card you add uses the same configuration by default, though you can change it. In the Project pane, the list of resusable configurations is the list of all of the configurations that you have created in a project and that can be used in additional cards.
+
What are data types?:: Data types show the formats in which data are used in a flow. A local data type is defined within a particular card. A global data type is defined for a project and can be reused in multiple cards. See xref:salesforce-to-twilio.adoc[Create Your First Mule Application with Flow Designer] for examples of how you can create and use global data types.
+
What are dependencies?:: A dependency is any connector, core Mule Runtime component, API, or module that you use in a flow. The first time that you add one of those objects to a flow, you add the current version of it. Every time afterward that you use that object again in the flow, you use the same version of it. From time to time, that object might be updated in Exchange. If you would like your flow to benefit from the update, you can update the version of the object that you are using in your flow.
. The toolbar
+
Here you can undo and redo changes in a project, download a project, and change the zoom level of the canvas.
. The control bar
+
Here you can run the application for testing, as well as deploy the application to another environment.
. The *Problems* and *Logs* tabs
+
Click the first tab to see a list of any errors that are in a project. You can click a listed error to open the location in which the error occurs.
+
Click the second tab to see the log file for a project. The file can be helpful when you are troubleshooting problems running an application.

== What a flow looks like

Here is an example of a Mule application that consists of a single flow.

.The cards in the example flow from "Create Your First Mule Application with Flow Designer"
image::fd-annotated-2.png[]

In this example, the cards represent the following core components and connectors:

. The Subscribe Topic operation of the Salesforce connector
. The core component Set Variable
. The core component Choice
. Two instances of the SELECT operation of the Database connector
. The core component Transform
. The HTTP Request operation of the HTTP connector
. Another instance of the core component Transform
. The Send Message operation of the Twilio connector

To learn how to create this flow and what each card does, see xref::salesforce-to-twilio.adoc[Create Your First Mule Application with Flow Designer].

The first card in a flow is the trigger card, which represents the connector and operation that you want to use to start the movement of data through the flow.

To add a card to the end of a flow, you click the plus icon that follows the previous card.

To add a card between two cards, mouse over the arrow that appears between them. The arrow turns in to the plus icon, which you can then click.

== The meaning of the information in the grey area on cards

As you create a flow, specifying the data that cards receive as input and the data that cards produce as output, each card displays a gray area that contains information about the card's output.

.Gray area on the face of the Set Variable card from the flow in Figure 1
image::fd-one-card-grey-area.png[]

`<Icon to indicate state><Part of data>:<Data type>`

Icon:: If an icon is present, it has one of these meanings:
+
[%header,cols=2*]
|===
|Icon
|Meaning

|Plus sign
|This part of the data was added and included in the card's output.

|Triangle
|This part of the data was changed in the card's output.

|Minus sign
|This part of the data was removed and not included in the card's output.

|===
+
If no icon is present, then the part of the data was carried through the card unmodified.

Part of data:: The data structure that passes through a flow can have up to three parts: a payload, attributes, and one or more variables. A payload contains data, the attributes contain metadata about the data, and variables contain data that you do not want a flow to modify because you want to reuse it.

Data type:: The type of data that is contains the payload, the attributes, or variables. See "xref:about-data-types.adoc[Data Types]" for documentation of the data types that Flow Designer supports.

For an illustration of how the information in the gray areas can help you understand how data moves through your flows, let's walk through part of the flow from Figure 1. To see the gray areas better, we can break the flow into chunks and zoom in to see each chunk in more detail.

.The first two cards
image::fd-gray-matter-1.png[]

. The first card is the trigger for the flow. It receives input from Salesforce, and the card produces output in the form of a new payload of data and a new set of attributes about the data.
. The second card produces output that leaves the payload and the attributes unchanged, but includes a new variable that is named `OppDetails`.
//-

.The Choice router
image::fd-gray-matter-2.png[]

[start=3]
. The third card is a Choice router, which evaluates a condition that you specify and then, according to the result of the evaluation, routes the flow's data through one or two or more possible paths. In this case there are three mutually exclusive paths. The gray area on the Choice card shows that the card produces output that passes the payload, attributes, and variable without changing any of them.
. The first possible path contains a Database Connector card. The gray area shows that the output of the card contains a modified payload and the same variable `OppDetails` with the value unchanged. However, the output removes the attributes.
. The next possible path also contains a Database Connector card, The gray area on this card is the same as for the previous card. That does not mean, however, that the changes to the payload are identical. The icon gives no information about the content of the changes to the payload.
. The last possible path contains a Set Payload card, which shows that it modified the payload and kept unchanged both the attributes and the variable.

.The next two cards
image::fd-gray-matter-3.png[]

[start=7]
. The next card is a Transform card. The gray area shows that the card modified the payload, but kept the attributes and the variable unchanged.
+
You might be wondering why the card shows that it did not modify the attributes, given that in the Choice router two Database Connector cards removed the attributes. How can the Transform card contain the attributes that had been moving through the flow until the Database Connector cards?
+
Recall that the Choice router always selects only one path to move data through, and does not move data through each of the paths that it contains. Moreover, one of the paths in a Choice router is the default path. When you are creating a flow, the Choice router routes to the default path. In the Choice router that we looked at above, the default path did not remove the attributes.
. The last card in this illustration is an HTTP Request card. It modifies the payload and the attributes, but keeps the variable unchanged.
