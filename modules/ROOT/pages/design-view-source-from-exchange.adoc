= View the Source Project for Assets Published to Exchange

After publishing an asset to Anypoint Exchange, you can view the source files in the API Designer. Exchange provides a direct link to the API Designer project containing the source files.

== Procedure

. Open the API specification or fragment in Anypoint Exchange.
. Open the pop-up menu for the asset version whose source you want to view.
. Select *View code in API Designer*
+
API Designer opens the project in read-only view.

. To edit the files in the project, click *Edit spec*.
+
This option is only available if you have edit permissions on the project and the project exists in API Designer.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If a project was published to Exchange via a ZIP file or other resource outside of API Designer, you can only view the contents of the project. To edit the files, create a new project based on the contents of the file.
