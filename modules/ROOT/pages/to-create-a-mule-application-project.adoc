= Start Creating a Mule Application from an Existing One (Flow Designer)

There are two ways that you can start creating a Mule application from an existing one:

* <<Clone an existing Mule-application project>>
* <<Import an existing Mule-application project>>


[[bookmark-a,Clone an existing Mule-application project]]
== Clone an existing project

You can base a new Mule-application project on one an existing one. Your new project includes almost everything that is in the existing project, even any custom data types and sample data that are defined in that project. 

=== Procedure

. Select an existing Mule-application project in the list of projects in Design Center.

. Click the *Clone* icon, which looks like this:
+
image:to-create-a-mule-application-project-cfeff.png[]

. Name your new project.

=== Result

Flow Designer opens the new project. Red circles indicate that you need to provide authentication information, so that  Flow Designer can connect to the systems that the cards represent. Click an entry in the *Reusable Configurations* list in the *Project* pane, which is on the left side of the canvas. Flow Designer opens the configuration and displays a red border on either side of each field that requires information from you.

Another way of finding these fields is to click the *Problems* tab in the bottom-right corner of the Flow Designer screen to open the *Problems* pane. When you click an entry in the pane, Flow Designer displays the field that corresponds to it.

=== What to Do Next

After you provide the required information, you can change the application as you like, developing it as you would any other Mule application.

[[bookmark-b,Import an existing Mule-application project]]
== Import an existing project

You can import a Mule-application project that was exported from Flow Designer by using the *Download source* option. This feature supports two different scenarios:

* Importing a project that was exported from a different environment within a single organization
* Importing a project that was exported from an environment that is in a different organization

[IMPORTANT]
====
An exported project does not include items that the project linked to in its original location.	An imported project does not include drivers or other types of library that the project included its original location. If an imported project contains any connectors that require libraries, you must open those connectors and set up the required libraries.

For example, if the project contains a Database connector, the database driver for that connector is not included in the exported project. After you import the project, you must open the Database connector, browse to the location of the database driver, and select it.	For example, if an imported project contains a Database connector, the database driver for that connector is not included in the project. You must open the Database connector and set up the driver.

////

* If you plan to import a Mule application that was exported from Anypoint Studio, ensure that, when it was exported, these options were selected:
** In the Export dialog: *Mule* > *Anypoint Studio Project to Mule Deployable Archive (includes Studio metadata)*
** In the Export Mule Project dialog:
*** Select *Attach project sources*.
*** Select *Only export project sources*.
* Studio supports all of the core components that come with Mule Runtime, while Design Center supports a subset. If you want to import a project that was exported from Studio, ensure that the project includes core components from the following list only:
** Choice
** Flow Reference
** For Each
** Logger
** Scheduler
** Set Payload
** Set Variable
** Transform
** Try

=== Procedure

[IMPORTANT]
====
To import a project from a `.jar` file, your account must have permissions to create Mule applications. If you do not have this permission, the option to import a jar file is not available in the *Import from File* dialog.
====


. On the *Projects* page of Design Center, click the *Create new* button and then click *Import from File*.
. Specify a name to give to the imported project.
. Click *Choose file*, then browse your filesystem for the `.jar` file that contains the project.
. Click *Import and Create project*.

=== Result

Flow Designer opens the new project.

[NOTE]
====
If one or more connectors, components, or modules referenced by the project are custom-developed and not available in your environment, then the import fails with a message like this one:

....
Unable to resolve dependency 2bacbe78-4300-965a-39fce81ee15d:mule-plugin-americanflights:jar:mule-plugin:1.0.0
Where
2bacbe78-4300-965a-39fce81ee15d is the Maven groupI for the artifact
Mule-plugin-americanfligths is the Maven artifact ID
jar is the type of the Maven artifact
mule-plugin is the classifier of the Maven artifact
1.0.0 is the version of the Maven artifact.
....

If you see such an error, ask the owner of the asset xref:exchange::to-publish-assets-maven.adoc[to publish it to Exchange by using Maven].

====

=== What to Do Next

You can change the application as you like, developing it as you would any other Mule application.
