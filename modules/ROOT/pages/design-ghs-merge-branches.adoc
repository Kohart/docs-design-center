Merge branches to combine a target branch with changes from a forked source branch (feature branch). The target branch reflects these changes, and the source branch remains untouched. You can perform this action within the API Designer interface.

== Before You Begin

* Within Anypoint Platform, your user ID must be assigned the Design Center Developer permission.
* You must be signed in to GitHub.
* The GitHub Sync application must be xref:design-ghs-install-authorize.adoc[installed and authorized].

== Procedure

. In the Design Center *Projects* list, click on a project name to open the text editor. The *Merge* button appears next to the branch selector component button (if branches have already been created).

. Click Merge.
+

. Select the target branch in the dropdown list of branches.
. Expand *Advanced Settings*.
. Enable *Squash commits* to “flatten” the commit history. Squashing commits is recommended, as this compacts the source branch’s commits into a single commit for merging, thereby keeping the target branch’s commit history clean and concise.
. Enable *Delete branch* to automatically delete the source branch after merging.
. Click *Merge*.
+
Upon completion, the merge target branch becomes the current branch.
