There are two methods that you can use to deploy a Mule application.

xref:promote-app-prod-env-design-center.adoc[Deploy a Mule Application from Flow Designer]:: All Mule applications that you create with Flow Designer are created in the Design environment. When a Mule application that you've created is ready to go live, you can deploy it to another environment, if your organization allows you to do so.


xref:fd-deploy-app-from-rm.adoc[Deploy a Mule Application from Runtime Manager]:: It might be the case that you are not allowed to deploy an application directly from Flow Designer. Your organization might require someone with the proper authority to deploy applications from Runtime Manager. You can share with that person a copy of your project as a `.jar` file to deploy your application with.
