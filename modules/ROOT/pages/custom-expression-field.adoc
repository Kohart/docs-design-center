= Create a DataWeave Expression in a Field (Flow Designer)
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

You can create DataWeave expressions in fields in cards, mixing expressions with text or using them alone, to create dynamic values when flows are triggered at runtime. A new editor provides aids for creating expressions.

== About this task

Every card in a flow presents a list on its right side. The first entry in the list is labelled `Custom Expression`. (Other entries in the list appear when a card is preceded by at least one other card. However, for this task, you need only the `Custom Expression` entry.)

== Procedure

. Open the card in which you want to add a DataWeave expression to a field.
. Click `Custom Expression` in the list on the right side of the card and drag it into the field.
+
[NOTE]
====
When you drag the *Custom Expression* element, the card highlights the borders of the fields that you can drop it into.
====
// .If the field is a select field, scroll down in the field and select *Custom*. A new text field appears below the select field. Click `Custom Expression` in the list on the right side of the card and drag it into the new field.
. Click the arrow in `expression` entry, then click *Expand* in the window that appears below the entry.
. Compose your expression with the help of the right side of the editor.
+
* Select the *Add Data* pane to choose from payload elements, attributes, and variables to add to the expression. Click to add them at the point in the expression where the cursor is located.
+
* Select the *Add Functions* pane to choose from DataWeave functions. Click to add them at the point in the expression where the cursor is located. Clicking a function also displays a description of it.
