= Adding Dependencies to an API-Specification Project
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

In projects for API specifications or RAML API fragments, you can add dependencies of either API fragments (RAML) or
rulesets. Because the dependencies are referenced in Anypoint Exchange, you cannot directly edit them in your projects.

If you export your project or someone downloads your project as RAML from Exchange, the resulting ZIP file contains the referenced dependencies.

CAUTION: Editing the referenced dependencies in an editor other than the API Designer editor is not supported. If you export your project to work on it in another editor, edit the referenced dependencies, 
and then try to import the project back into the text editor, the import fails.

== Add Dependencies to an API-Specification Project

To add dependencies to an API-specification project:

. In the text editor navigation menu, click the *Exchange dependencies* icon (image:manage-dependency-versions-design-center-d96c7.png[title="Exchange Dependencies icon"]).
. Click the add icon (+) for the dependency type that you want to add.
  You can select from the dependencies that are visible to the organizations that you belong to.

A list of dependencies is shown based on the default criteria:

* API type of the project to which you are adding them
* *Stable* lifecycle state

To change the criteria, click *Edit criteria*. 

[select-dependency-versions]
=== Select Dependency Versions

To select from the listed versions of dependencies, such as fragments or rulesets:

. Click the check box for the dependency you want to add. 
. If you want to use a version of a dependency other than latest, select the version for that dependency in the *Version* drop-down. 
. After you select some dependencies, you can click *Show selected only* to view only the selected ones. 
. After you select the dependency versions you want to add, click *Add dependency*. 

NOTE: API Designer supports a maximum of 1,000 files for dependencies, with a total file size no greater than 300 MB.
 
To view the contents of a dependency, click the more options menu icon (image:overflow-menu-icon.png[width=0.90%,height=0.90%,title="More options menu icon"]) for that dependency and then select *Show in Files* or *Open in Exchange*. 

NOTE: If you select *Show in Files*, the *Files* section expands and the dependencies are shown under the `exchange_modules` section. The subsections correspond to the URI for the referenced dependency, which is its asset identifier, or GAV (group ID/asset ID/version), in Exchange.

When you are ready to continue work on your API project, click *Files* > API project file name.

[[ruleset-dependencies]]
== Ruleset Dependencies

include::design-center::partial$design-add-ruleset-dependencies.adoc[]

Even if your projects have not been identified as requiring action, you can proactively check the conformance of your APIs by adding published rulesets as dependencies to your API project. 

[fix-gov-issues]
== Fix Governance Conformance Issues

After you add the rulesets as dependencies, you can view the conformance messages in the *Project Errors* section of the text editor. Use the provided information to fix any conformance issues and then republish your API definition.
