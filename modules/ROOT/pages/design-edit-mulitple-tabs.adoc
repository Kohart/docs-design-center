You can have multiple files open at a time in API Designer's text editor. There are four ways that you can open a file in a new tab:

* Right-click a file in the file tree and select *Open in new tab*.
* Press the Command key (MacOS) or the Control key (Windows) and click the name of the file in the file tree.
* Place your cursor in the name of a file for an `include` tag. Then, press the Command key (MacOS) or the Control key (Windows) and click the filename.
* In the errors view at the bottom of the text screen, click the link to the location of a file listed in the view.

The tab bar appears at the top of the editor only when at least two files are open.
