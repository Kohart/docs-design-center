All Mule applications that you create with Flow Designer are created in the Design environment. When a Mule application that you've created is ready to go live, you can deploy it to another environment, if your organization allows you to do so. The target environment must have enough vCores to accommodate the application; otherwise, deployment will fail.

As you deploy your application, you can change connector configurations and connections. You need to do this if there are differences between the testing and target environments that would necessitate such changes. For example, if you tested your app in the *Sandbox* environment and now want to deploy it to a production environment, you most likely need to replace the connections that each connector used for connecting to test systems with connections for connecting to production systems.

[NOTE]
====
Any changes that you make to configurations when you deploy an application are not applied to the configurations in your project. The changes are applied only to the application that you are deploying.

For example, suppose that your application uses the configuration ConfigA for a connector. In the project, ConfigA uses the connection ConnA. When you deploy the application, you change ConfigA to use a different connection: ConnB. However, ConfigA continues to use ConnA in your project.

====

After you deploy your application, the values for all of its properties are secured in Runtime Manager in the *Properties* section of the *Settings* page for the application. To see the list of an application's properties in Runtime Manager, click *Applications*, select the application, click *Settings*, and click *Properties*.

== To Deploy a Mule App from Flow Designer
. Click the arrow in the top-right corner of Flow Designer and then select *Deploy application*.
+
.The *Deploy application* option appears in this menu.

[calloutlist]
. Click the arrow.
. Select the option.

[start=2]
. Select the CloudHub environment to deploy the application to.
. Accept the default name for the deployed application or enter a new one.
. If you want to change the way that any of the connectors in your application connect to systems, click *Customize connections for this deployment* to see a list of the connectors in the app. Click on a connector to see a list of the connections that are available for the connector to use.

== What to Do Next

You can go to Runtime Manager to manage the application. To get there from Flow Designer, click the three-dots icon to the left of the *Deploy* button and select *View in Runtime Manager*.
