API specification designers often use multiple authoring and version control tools. This can result in having to maintain several different specification versions. 

API Designer GitHub Sync is a version control tool that seamlessly maintains API specifications existing in several locations. The feature enables a two-way sync between API Designer and your GitHub repository, automatically capturing changes to API projects and sending the changes to a synced GitHub repository of your choice. Similarly, the application automatically propagates to your API project any changes made in a synced GitHub repository.

This bidirectional flow extends API Designer into a collaborative environment where the single source of truth is always GitHub. Unlimited collaborators can share and contribute to the same content.

You can:

* Create new GitHub repositories that sync with existing API projects.
* Create new API projects that sync with new GitHub repositories.
* Create new API projects that sync with existing remote GitHub repositories.

Additionally, you can perform GitHub-specific actions from within the API Designer UI, e.g. open pull requests, view branch diffs, view sync status, and resolve merge conflicts.

The following diagram illustrates two-way sync between an API project and a remote GitHub repository:
