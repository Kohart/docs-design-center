Installing the GitHub Synchronization application in an organization is the first step in making the organizationâ€™s repositories accessible to API Designer.

Install the GitHub Synchronization application within the GitHub user interface. Perform this action either as a GitHub organization administrator or as a GitHub user. Then, authorize the application when performing a GitHub Synchronization action for the first time within API Designer. Synchronization actions include creating new GitHub repositories for existing API specifications and creating new API specifications that are synchronized with existing GitHub repositories.

== Install the GitHub Synchronization Application as a GitHub Organization Administrator

To get started, first install the GitHub Synchronization application within the GitHub user interface.

=== Before You Begin

To install the GitHub Synchronization application as a GitHub organization administrator, you must have:

* A GitHub account
* A membership in the GitHub organization where the application will be installed
* The administrator permission to access the GitHub organization (as configured through your GitHub account settings)

=== Install the GitHub Synchronization application

. Navigate to the https://github.com/apps/mulesoft-github-integration[GitHub Synchronization application page^].
. Click *Install*.
. In the *Install MuleSoft GitHub Integration* dialog, select an organization in which to install the application.
. Click *All repositories* to make all repositories available, or click *Only select repositories* and specify individual repositories.
. Click *Install*.

The application must be authorized in API Designer to complete the integration with GitHub. See xref:design-ghs-install-authorize.adoc#authorize-the-github-sync-application-in-api-designer[Authorize the GitHub Sync Application in API Designer].

== Install the GitHub Synchronization Application as a GitHub User

Installing the GitHub Synchronization application in a GitHub user account enables you to sync your individual GitHub user repositories. 

=== Before You Begin

To install the GitHub Synchronization application as a GitHub user, you must have:

* A GitHub account.
* A membership in the GitHub organization where the application will be installed.

=== Install the GitHub Synchronization Application

. Navigate to the https://github.com/apps/mulesoft-github-integration[GitHub Synchronization application page^].
. Click *Install*.
. In the *Install MuleSoft GitHub Integration* dialog, select a GitHub user account (typically the first items in the displayed list).
. Click *All repositories* to make all repositories available, or click *Only select repositories* and specify individual repositories.
. Click *Install*.

The application must be authorized in API Designer to complete the integration with GitHub. See xref:design-ghs-install-authorize.adoc#authorize-the-github-sync-application-in-api-designer[Authorize the GitHub Synchronization Application in API Designer].

== Authorize the GitHub Synchronization Application in API Designer

To authorize the GitHub Synchronization application ensure your user ID is assigned the Design Center Developer permission.

. Sign in to GitHub.
. On the Design Center *Projects* page, click *Create new*.
. Select *New API Spec*.
. In the *New API Spec* panel, click *Authorize the MuleSoft app now to get started*.
. Click *Authorize*.
. In the subsequent dialog, click *Authorize MuleSoft GitHub Integration*.

You are redirected to API Designer, which displays an *Authorized Successfully* message. You can now complete the process that originally triggered the application authorization.

== Troubleshooting GitHub Synchronization Application Installation

If you encounter errors when attempting to authorize the GitHub Synchronization application, troubleshoot them as follows.

=== Deauthorize the GitHub Synchronization application

Resolve common issues by deauthorizing and then reauthorizing the GitHub Synchronization application. You can deauthorize the application by clicking *Revoke* in the GitHub user interface (Settings->Applications->Authorized GitHub Apps).

=== The *GitHub Organization* list is empty when specifying a repository to sync 

The GitHub Synchronization application must be installed either in a GitHub organization or in a GitHub user account before performing any sync action.
