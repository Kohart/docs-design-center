When creating an API Designer project, you can also create a GitHub repository and synchronize the repository with the project.

== Before You Begin

* Within Anypoint Platform, your user ID must be assigned the Design Center Developer permission.
* You must be signed in to GitHub.
* The GitHub Synchronization application must be xref:design-ghs-install-authorize.adoc[installed and authorized].

== Procedure

. On the Design Center *Projects* page, click *Create new*.
. Select *New API Spec*.
+
The following *New API Spec* dialog appears:
+

. Specify an API title.
. Select *I’m comfortable with designing it on my own*.
. Click the *Sync this project with an external GitHub repository checkbox*.
+
The dialog expands to include the following:
+

. Select an organization in the GitHub Organization list.
+
NOTE: The *GitHub Organization* list remains empty if the GitHub Synchronization application is not installed. See xref:design-ghs-install-authorize.adoc[Install and Authorize the MuleSoft GitHub Synchronization Application].

. Click *Create API Spec*. 
+
You are navigated to the new project’s text editor.

In addition to synchronizing GitHub repositories when creating API specifications, you can synchronize a new GitHub repository when creating fragments and when importing APIs.
