= Creating New Projects Synchronized with New GitHub Repositories

When creating an API Designer project, you can also create a GitHub repository and synchronize the repository with your project.

== Before You Begin

Before you create and synchronize a project, ensure you have:

* The Design Center Developer permission within Anypoint Platform
* xref:design-ghs-install-authorize.adoc[Installed and authorized] the GitHub Synchronization application
* Signed into GitHub

== Synchronize A New Project

. On the Design Center *Projects* page, click *Create new*.
. Select *New API Spec*.
. In the *New API Spec* dialog, specify an API title.
. Select *I’m comfortable with designing it on my own*.
. Click the *Sync this project with an external GitHub repository* checkbox.
. In the expanded dialog, select an organization from the *GitHub Organization* list.
+
NOTE: The *GitHub Organization* list remains empty if the GitHub Synchronization application is not installed.

. If necessary, specify a new name for the repository. 
. Click *Create API Spec*. 
+
You are navigated to the new project’s text editor.

In addition to synchronizing GitHub repositories when creating API specifications, you can synchronize a new GitHub repository when creating fragments and importing APIs.
