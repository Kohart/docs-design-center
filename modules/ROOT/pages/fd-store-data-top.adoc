Variables are used to store values for use within a flow of a Mule app. After you create a variable, you can use it in any subsequent cards in the flow.

There are two methods for storing values in variables.


xref::to-create-and-populate-a-variable.adoc[Store All or Part of the Output of a Card in a Variable]:: You can use a Set Variable card to create a variable that stores or manipulates data from the output of a card. You can then reuse that data in a later card by using the variable.

xref::fd-store-reuse-output.adoc[Store the Entire Output of a Card in a Variable]:: You can store the output of a card, rather than pass the output on to the next card in a flow. Normally, a card outputs data that is different from the data that it received as input. However, when you create a target variable, the card stores its output -- as is, reduced, or manipulated -- into that variable and passes to the next card both the variable and the same message that it received as input.
