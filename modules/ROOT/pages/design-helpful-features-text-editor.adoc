The text editor makes it easy to perform the following:

* Rename declarable objects
* Find the names of declarable objects by highlighting them
* Find locations where a definition is referenced
* Select code ranges
* Navigate to a symbol
* Extract an element to a declaration

== Rename Declarable Objects

Using only one action, you can rename declarable objects everywhere they are used in a project.

You can right-click the name of an object where it is declared, select *Rename Symbol*, and provide a new name. The object is thereby renamed wherever it is used in all of the files of the current project that are associated with the root file of the project, but the object is not renamed where only mentioned.

For example, in the following example API specification `product_name` is declared as a type on line 5 at callout 1, mentioned at callout 2, and used on line 17 at callout 3. If you right-click `product_name` at callout 1 and use the *Rename Symbol* option to change its name, `product_name` is changed only at callout 3.

            type: product_name  <3>

== Highlight the Names of Declarable Objects

You can highlight the names of declarable objects where they are used in a file.

To see all of the locations in a file where an object is used, click the cursor in the name of the object where that object is declared.

For example, the type `person` is declared on line 5 at the first callout in the following example API specification. That type is subsequently used on line 16 at the second callout. If you click `person` on line 5, the text editor highlights `person` on line 16.

  person:  <1>
    type: object

      200:
        body:
          application/json:
            type: person  <2>
----

This highlighting works for all declarable objects, such as types, security schemes, resource types, and traits.

Highlighting appears only where the object is used, not every location where its name appears. For example, in the following example API specification, `person` is declared as a type on line 5 at callout 1, mentioned on line 14 at callout 2, and used on line 17 at callout 3. When you click in `person` at callout 1, `person` is highlighted only at callout 3.

== Find Locations Where a Definition is Referenced

You can navigate to locations where a given definition is referenced by right-clicking on the definition and selecting *Go to References*.

For example, the type `person` is declared on line 5 at the first callout in the following example API specification. That type is subsequently used on line 14 at the second callout, and on line 22 at the third callout. If you right-click `person` on line 5 and select *Go to References*, a list of the `person` locations (callouts two and three) appears. Double clicking on a listed location will navigate you to the relevant line.

The action also supports the following:

* RAML resource types and traits
* RAML type expressions
* Library aliases
* References linked in JSON path navigation
* References to nodes that apply “macros”, such as annotationTypes, securitySchemes, resourceTypes and traits

== Select Code Ranges

“Selection Ranges” allow you to select and to expand the selection of code blocks. 

To select a range, click on an element and press Control + Shift + [Left Arrow | Right Arrow]. The Right Arrow key increases the range. The Left Arrow key decreases the range.

For example, clicking on `body` in the following code, and pressing Control + Shift + Right Arrow, creates a selection range that only includes `body:`:

image:apid-helpful-text-editor-1.png[30%,30%]

Pressing Control + Shift + Right Arrow again results in the following selection range:

image:apid-helpful-text-editor-2.png[30%,30%]

Pressing Control + Shift + Left Arrow collapses the selection range, leaving only `body:` selected again.

== Navigate to a Symbol

You can right-click anywhere in the document and select *Go to Symbol*, which will present the list of defined symbols: 

image:apid-helpful-text-editor-3.png[75%,75%]

Selecting a symbol will navigate you to its location in the document.

== Extract an Element to a Declaration

You can take advantage of refactoring helpers to ease the continuous improvement of the design. One such helper is the ability to extract an inline declarable element to a top-level declaration, with the result being reusabiity.

When you select a range that matches an inline declarable element, an icon appears to the left of the element:

image:apid-helpful-text-editor-4.png[37%,37%]

Tap the icon and select *Extract to Declaration*, which results in the following two changes to the document:

image:apid-helpful-text-editor-5.png[37%,37%]

The first callout shows that `type: lib.manager` has been replaced with `type: newtype`. A `newtype` declaration now exists outside of the `manager` scope (as shown at the second callout), thereby making `newtype` reusable.

The extracted declaration name is based on the original name. If the name is already being used by another declaration of the same kind, an auto increment number is added at the end of the name. You can rename the declaration.

Along with `types` declarations, you can also extract `resourceTypes` declarations and `traits` declarations.
